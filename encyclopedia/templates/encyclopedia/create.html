<!-- This is the page where the user will be able to create a new entry for the wiki -->

{% extends "encyclopedia/layout.html" %}

<!-- I will add a title that says "Create new entry" on the browser's tab. I will send it from a new function
from the views.py file. -->
{% block title %}
    {{title}}
{% endblock %}

{% block body %}

    <!-- This prints a title saying "Create New Page" on the body of the page -->
    <h1>Create New Page</h1>

    <!-- Now, to let the user add a title and a body to the new entry article, I will create 2 forms. The 1st form
    will let the user insert a title for the entry. Meanwhile, the 2nd form will have the textarea where the user
    will be able to insert the markdown code with the entry content. I will let the user write markdown code on the
    title since all other .md files already have the title with a “#”, which is markdown code. That is, for
    consistency’s sake, I will let the user also type the title using markdown.

    It would be a good idea to make the 2 forms with the title and the content of the new entry to have a POST
    method. I don’t need to put the entry and the entirety of the content for that entry into the URL. Also, that
    would make it easy for me to get that content and send it to views.py to insert that content into a variable.

    The 2 forms for the entry creation will be created on the create.html file by using the <form> and <input>
    tags. I will add a “Submit” (or “Save”) button, so that the user doesn’t have to press the Enter key each time
    they want to save an entry.

    As the assignment says, I need to use a <textarea> tag for the content of the entry. This way, the user will be
    able to type the description of the new entry.

    This part of the assignment isn’t explicitly asking me to send the title and the body of the newly created entry
    to a new .md file. It’s just asking me to accept input from the user. So, I will first create the form with
    the title and the body of the new entry, the submit button, and a label for each input box.

    "Text area" wasn't an input: it's a tag of its own. It's written as <textarea> (source:
    https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_textarea .)

    I will give each input a "name" attribute to be able to get their data from the views.py file once I submit
    the form.

    I NEED to add a CRF token since I'm using a POST request with this form.

    Note: I could edit the text of the submit button to “Save”, since it’s currently only displaying text in Spanish 
    from my computer. That can be done by assigning the <input> tag with the submit button the “value” attribute, and 
    giving it the value of “Save” (source: 
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14007613/change-text-from-submit-on-input-tag/14007619 .)
    
    I added an error message if the user types the title of an entry that already exists.
    -->
    {% if error_message == 'Error' %}
        <p style="color: red;"><b>Sorry, but an entry with that title already exists. Please, use another title.</b></p>
    {% endif %}
    <form method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <input type="text" name="entry-title" placeholder="Title of the Entry (e.g: JS)">
        <br>
        <textarea name="entry-body" placeholder="Description of the Entry (e.g: # JS (line break) JS is a programming language )"></textarea>
        <br>
        <input type="submit" value="Save">
    </form>
